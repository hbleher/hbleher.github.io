I am a research associate at the Department of Social Ethics and currently a ministry trainee in the Protestant Church of W端rttemberg. Previously, I was a researcher and lecturer at the University of Bonn and the FAU Erlangen-N端rnberg.

I studied Protestant Theology in Neuendettelsau, Erlangen, Stellenbosch (South Africa) and T端bingen. From 2012 to 2018 I was a scholarship holder of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Evangelische Stift T端bingen. In 2023 I was awarded the Zia Fellowship "Visible Women in Science" by the ZEIT publishing house.

My interdisciplinary research focuses on the ethics and governance of artificial intelligence. From 2020 to 2024 I was a researcher in the interdisciplinary project "SMART Start: Smart Sensors in Pregnancy Care", funded by the German Federal Ministry of Health. Since 2021, I am a research associate at SFB 1483 EmpkinS, a Collaborative Research Center funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

In my doctoral thesis, I explore concepts and theories of compromise from a theological-ethical and political-theoretical perspective.
